# Twitch.tv Add-on for Stremio
This Add-on allows you to fetch live streams from Twitch.tv in Stremio

**As the Twitch.tv API requires a Client ID in order to work, the `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` process environment variable must be set prior to running this Add-on.**

## How to run

**Linux / OSX**

```
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="my-secret-client-id"
npm start
```

**Win**

```
set TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="my-secret-client-id"
npm start
```
